# Stacks: Check Brackets

## Asignment

Stacks are used to check that parentheses match in an equation.
Write a program that asks the user to input a string containing parentheses of the three types:   ( )  [  ] and {  } and then tell him/her whether they are right or wrong.

For example:

```
Abc(xyz)mnv             Correct
Abc(xyz]bnm             Wrong mismatched brackets
Abc( xcvbnm,m           Wrong bracket opened but never closed
Abc(cvb{bgt}vde)dfg     Correct
Abc(fgfd{gg)dfg}nn      Wrong mismatched brackets
Abc)nmg                 Wrong bracket closed but never opened 

```
